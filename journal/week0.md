# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

> [Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG8blanhAOg&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=12 )

## AWS CLI

- Installed AWS CLI
- updated [.gitpod.yml](../.gitpod.yml) to include:

  ```bash
  tasks:
  - name: aws-cli
    env:
      AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT: on-partial
    init: |
      cd /workspace
      curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
      unzip awscliv2.zip
      sudo ./aws/install
      cd $THEIA_WORKSPACE_ROOT
  ```

## Enable Billing

- [Billing Page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/) -> `Billing Preferences` -> `Receive Billing Alerts`
- Save Preferences

## Creating a Billing Alarm

### Create SNS Topic

- We need an SNS topic before we create an alarm.
- The SNS topic is what will delivery us an alert when we get overbilled
- [aws sns create-topic](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sns/create-topic.html)

Creating an SNS Topic

```shell
aws sns create-topic --name billing-alarm
```

which will return a TopicARN

We'll create a subscription supply the TopicARN and our Email

```shell
aws sns subscribe \
    --topic-arn TopicARN \
    --protocol email \
    --notification-endpoint your@email.com
```

Check your email and confirm the subscription

#### Create Alarm

- [aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudwatch/put-metric-alarm.html)
- [Create an Alarm via AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cloudwatch-estimatedcharges-alarm/)
- We need to update the configuration json script with the TopicARN we generated earlier
- We are just a json file because --metrics is is required for expressions and so its easier to us a JSON file.

```sh
aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm --cli-input-json file://aws/json/alarm_config.json
```

## Create an AWS Budget

[aws budgets create-budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/budgets/create-budget.html)

Get your AWS Account ID

```sh
aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text
```

- Supply your AWS Account ID
- Update the json files
- This is another case with AWS CLI its just much easier to json files due to lots of nested json

```bash
aws budgets create-budget \
    --account-id AccountID \
    --budget file://aws/json/budget.json \
    --notifications-with-subscribers file://aws/json/budget-notifications-with-subscribers.json
```

## Budgets using console

I use AWS Budgets to monitor and track my AWS spending so as to make adjustments to my usage and cost as required to ensure I dont exceed my budget.

Two budgets created:

- *My Zero-Spend Budget* - Tracks my credit spend and alerts me $0.01

- *Track Credit Spend* - Tracks my credit spend and alerts me via SNS if I go beyond 85% of my budget

## Identity Access and Management (IAM)

On IAM Console, I created a new user, and generated AWS credentials.
